# Screenshots

Add your screenshots here before publishing:

1. **parsed-tree.png** - The Parsed Tree view showing an XML file
2. **object-view.png** - The Object View with some nodes expanded/collapsed
3. **graphical-tree.png** - The Mermaid diagram view with zoom controls
4. **split-view.png** - The Split View showing both views side by side

## How to Take Screenshots

1. Open VS Code with the extension installed
2. Open the `students.xml` sample file
3. Open the tree viewer (click tree icon in title bar)
4. Switch to each view and take a screenshot
5. Recommended size: **1200x800 pixels**
6. Save as PNG in this folder

## Tips for Good Screenshots

- Use a clean VS Code theme (Dark+ or Light+ default)
- Show meaningful XML data (the students.xml works well)
- Expand some nodes in Object View to show interactivity
- For Graphical Tree, zoom to show the whole diagram clearly
- Crop to remove unnecessary UI elements
